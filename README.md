## Credits

Two repositories, API and Angular frontend repository are currently being merged to this one repository. I decided to do so, to ease up the release process.

## Usage üí°

This API generates a list of point coordinates, or let's you use your own list,
and calculates the shortest possible loop that connects every point using metaheuristic approach.

0) To run the API and website interface locally type:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

1) Then go to the:
> localhost:8080

..., and see for yourself. üòâ

2) You can also connect to the API directly. 
* Use dynamically created Swagger documentation to see possible endpoints / updated documentation.
* It is accessible under:
> ...:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#
* For localhost:
> [localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/)
